 Go figure, theres a lot of data in pokemon
Unfortunately, when i attempted to use an API, i ran into issues where there was too much data to import, and it would cut off early.
So all of this had to be entered by hand
Since there is... a LOT of data, consider this more a proof-of-concept rather than a fully finished pokemon sim
A solid portion of code is infastructure for things i didn't even have time to impliment.

  Use the example team i managed to make data for:
